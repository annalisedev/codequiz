## Description

This week's Challenge required the build from scratch a short Javascript Coding Quiz. There was no starter code provided, therefore it required me to build the HTML, CSS and JS files. I began this through producing the outline structure for the HTML file and some basic CSS layouts. I then began the logic of the JS file, with the timer counting down. There were several options for the questions, I decided to create an object holding the qestions and keys and answers as values. The overall structure is one HTML page for the most part, hiding and displaying various div's from the file. The only separate HTML was the highscores page. I also decided to use a separate JS file for this as it was creating a table from the local storage. 

The page meets the acceptance criteria provided in the challenge. It has a clean, polished and responsive user interface. It runs in the broswer and features dynamically updating HTML, CSS and JS code that I have written.

## Support

Some external sources that supported me to understand the task and write the code were the link below to create the table from the local storage where I copied some of this code. I also used the weekly activities for JS considerably as I solved these questions. No other code was copied.
